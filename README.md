# MultiCalculator

## WHAT EVERYONE IS WORKING ON
- Mukund: Clicking buttons puts numbers on screen in raw text

## TODO
1. Replace concrete is statements and casts with interfaces, eg, IUnaryOperator
2. Fix the buttons in primary calc they are too small
3. Make sure rounded button (non shiftable) is extracted to separate user control, so we can have a type which inherits from it which has a button and one that doesnt- in fact, just proper inheritance for buttons for the three kinds, rounded, rounded with single operation, rounded with double operation and label
